## About the Project
"Guess the Country" is an interactive game that challenges your geography knowledge. The goal is to guess the correct country based on feedback provided after each guess. 

### How it Works:
1. Enter your guess into the input field.
2. Based on your guess, you'll receive one of the following responses:
   - **Correct Country**: You've guessed the correct country and won the game!
   - **Direct Neighbor**: The guessed country shares a border with the correct country.
   - **Correct Continent**: The guessed country is on the same continent as the correct country.
   - **Wrong Continent**: The guessed country is on a completely different continent.

Use the feedback to narrow down your guesses and find the correct country.
